          <h2 class="section__title">Outreach Intent</h2>
          <p>This project was developed as an educational outreach initiative to make complex robotics concepts accessible to learners across different age groups and educational backgrounds. Our primary goal was to demystify path planning algorithms and demonstrate their practical applications in everyday technology.</p>
          
          <p>By creating content tailored for junior students, high school learners, and undergraduate audiences, we aimed to build a foundation of understanding that grows with the learner. We believe that robotics education should not be confined to university laboratories but should inspire curiosity and innovation at every level of learning.</p>

          <h2 class="section__title">Adapting Communication for Different Audiences</h2>
          
          <div class="card">
            <h3 class="card__title">Junior Audience (Ages 8-12)</h3>
            <p class="card__text">For younger learners, we focused on relatable analogies and visual storytelling. Path planning was explained through everyday experiences like navigating a playground or finding the shortest route home from school. We avoided technical jargon entirely and emphasized the fun, puzzle-solving nature of robot navigation.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3 class="card__title">High School Audience (Ages 13-18)</h3>
            <p class="card__text">High school content introduced foundational computer science concepts including graph theory and algorithmic efficiency. We balanced technical accuracy with accessibility, using real-world examples like GPS navigation and video game pathfinding to maintain engagement while building conceptual depth.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3 class="card__title">Undergraduate Audience (Ages 18+)</h3>
            <p class="card__text">For university-level learners, we provided technical rigor including mathematical formulations, complexity analysis, and implementation details of the A* algorithm. We explored heuristic functions, admissibility conditions, and optimization techniques while connecting theory to practical robotics applications.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
          <h2 class="section__title">Challenges and Learning Outcomes</h2>
          <p>Creating content for multiple audiences simultaneously presented unique challenges. We discovered that the most difficult task was not simplifying complex concepts, but rather determining what to omit at each level while maintaining conceptual integrity.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <p class="info-box__text">The interactive demonstration proved particularly valuable as it transcends age barriers. Visual learning through hands-on experimentation allows each audience to engage at their own level of understanding, making the same tool educational for all age groups.</p>
          </div>

          <p>This project reinforced our understanding that effective science communication requires empathy, creativity, and a deep understanding of both the subject matter and the audience. We learned to appreciate the power of analogies, the importance of visual design, and the value of interactive learning experiences.</p>
