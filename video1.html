          <h2 class="section__title">Understanding Robot Navigation</h2>
          
          <p>Imagine you are in a big playground and you want to get from the swings to the slide. You look around and see the quickest path, but there are other kids playing in the way. So you choose a different path that goes around them. Robots do something very similar when they need to move from one place to another.</p>

          <p>When a robot needs to travel somewhere, it uses special computer programs to figure out the best route. Just like when you play a maze game and try to find the path from start to finish, robots look at where they are, where they need to go, and what things are blocking their way. They then calculate the fastest and safest path to reach their goal.</p>

          <p>Think about your favorite video game character moving through a level. The character needs to avoid obstacles like walls, enemies, or pits while trying to reach the end of the level. Robots work the same way in real life. They have sensors that act like eyes to see obstacles around them, and their computer brain quickly figures out how to move around those obstacles to reach their destination safely.</p>
