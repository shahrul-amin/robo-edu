          <h2 class="section__title">Mathematical Foundations of A*</h2>
          
          <p>The A* algorithm represents one of the most elegant solutions to the single-source shortest path problem in robotics. Unlike uninformed search algorithms such as breadth-first search that explore the search space systematically without regard to the goal location, A* uses a heuristic function to guide exploration toward promising regions of the state space. The algorithm maintains an evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) represents the actual cost from the start node to node n, and h(n) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from n to the goal.</p>

          <p>The theoretical properties of A* depend critically on the admissibility of the heuristic function. A heuristic h(n) is admissible if it never overestimates the true cost to reach the goal from any node n. When using an admissible heuristic, A* is guaranteed to find the optimal path if one exists. Common admissible heuristics for grid-based path planning include Manhattan distance for 4-connected grids and Euclidean distance for continuous spaces. The choice of heuristic significantly impacts both the optimality guarantees and the computational efficiency of the algorithm.</p>

          <p>The completeness and optimality proofs of A* rest on several key properties. The algorithm maintains two sets: an open list of nodes to be evaluated, typically implemented as a priority queue ordered by f-value, and a closed list of already evaluated nodes. At each iteration, A* expands the node with the lowest f-value. The algorithm terminates when the goal node is expanded, at which point the path can be reconstructed by following parent pointers from the goal back to the start. Under admissible heuristics, A* expands all nodes with f(n) less than the optimal solution cost and no nodes with f(n) greater than this cost, making it optimally efficient among all algorithms using the same heuristic information.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <p class="info-box__text">The time complexity of A* is O(b^d) where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the solution, though in practice performance depends heavily on the quality of the heuristic. Space complexity is also O(b^d) as the algorithm must store all generated nodes.</p>

        <section class="section">
          <h2 class="section__title">Heuristic Design and Consistency</h2>
          
          <p>While admissibility ensures optimality, the stronger property of consistency (also called monotonicity) provides additional computational benefits. A heuristic h is consistent if for every node n and every successor n' generated by an action with cost c, the inequality h(n) ≤ c(n,n') + h(n') holds. Consistent heuristics are necessarily admissible, and they guarantee that when A* expands a node, it has already found the optimal path to that node. This property eliminates the need to re-open nodes that have been closed, significantly improving efficiency.</p>

          <p>The design of effective heuristics requires domain-specific knowledge and careful consideration of the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. More informed heuristics that closely approximate the true remaining cost lead to fewer node expansions but may require expensive computation at each step. Pattern databases, differential heuristics, and landmark-based approaches represent advanced techniques for constructing powerful heuristics in complex domains.</p>

        <section class="section">
          <h2 class="section__title">Extensions and Variants</h2>
          
          <p>Several important variants of A* address specific limitations or application requirements. Weighted A* introduces a parameter w ≥ 1 such that f(n) = g(n) + w·h(n), trading optimality for improved speed by focusing search more aggressively toward the goal. Iterative deepening A* (IDA*) reduces memory requirements by performing depth-first search with iteratively increasing cost thresholds. Anytime algorithms like ARA* provide approximate solutions quickly and improve them over time as computation continues, crucial for real-time robotics applications where immediate action is required.</p>

          <p>In multi-robot scenarios, coupled planning approaches extend A* to higher-dimensional state spaces where each dimension represents one robot's configuration. Decoupled approaches plan paths independently and then coordinate to avoid conflicts, trading completeness for computational tractability. Lifelong planning algorithms such as D* Lite efficiently replan as the robot discovers new obstacles during execution, making them particularly suitable for navigation in partially known or dynamic environments.</p>

          <p>Current research in path planning addresses challenges including high-dimensional configuration spaces for manipulators, planning under uncertainty with probabilistic roadmaps, and machine learning approaches that learn heuristics or policies from experience. Multi-objective optimization extends classical path planning to simultaneously minimize multiple costs such as distance, time, energy consumption, and risk. Integration with perception systems and safe learning frameworks represents crucial steps toward robust autonomous systems operating in unstructured real-world environments.</p>
